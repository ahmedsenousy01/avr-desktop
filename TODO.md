# TODO

---

## Features:

- [ ] store multiple provider keys and make keys selected per deployement
- [ ] env editor should have default env vars for each serice and display them with the ability to add/remove vars from each service
- [ ] make the docker compose creation reactive. whenever some configuration changes and is saved a new docker compose should be generated.
- [ ] MacOS support (build an abstraction layer for any part that has system interactions)

## Quality

- [ ] Error management system should be more robust (auto fix => suggestion => descriptive error => generic error)

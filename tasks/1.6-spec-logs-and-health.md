## Implementation Spec â€” Logs & Health

Implementation Order: 6

### Overview

Show per-service logs and health/status once containers are running.

### Goals

- Fast, filterable logs; clear health indicators.

### Functional Requirements

1. Stream logs from docker for selected services; tail/follow and search.
2. Show health status from `docker inspect` and summarize deployment status.
3. Error surfaces for crashes/restarts.

### UI/UX

- Tabs per service; search box; follow toggle.

### Data & Persistence

- Optional log export to `[deployment]/logs/`.

### IPC/Backend

- IPC streaming channel for logs; periodic status polling.

### Out of Scope

- Long-term metrics dashboard.

### Open Questions

- Standardize healthchecks or rely on status only.

### Notes

- Implementation planning will use the Generate Task List rule in `rules/`.

### Details

- Stream `docker compose logs -f [service]` via IPC with backpressure.
- Maintain ring buffer per service (default 2,000 lines) and search index.
- Poll `docker inspect` every N seconds for health/state.

### IPC API

- `logs:stream` (start/stop per service)
- `status:watch` (subscribe/unsubscribe)

### Renderer Components

- `LogsPanel` with service tabs; `HealthBadge` components.

### Acceptance Criteria

- Logs update in near real-time with follow toggle and search working.
- Health badges reflect state transitions promptly.

### Tasks Outline

- Implement streaming channels and buffers.
- Build UI tabs and search; render health badges.
